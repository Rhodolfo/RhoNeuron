# RhoNeuron

Implementing neural networks, purely out of interest.
I don't really have one unique source material for writting this, I'm making it up as I read new stuff.

I only have test modules so far,  
`$ sbt`  
`> test`  
we have Perceptron and Sigmoid XOR logic gates.

## To-do

Back propagation for Sigmoid neurons.
Training.
